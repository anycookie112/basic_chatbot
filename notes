so now main issue is the querying of vector db
db does not know expensive = higher number


so how do i incoporate agents into this 

i need a planner 
https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/plan-and-execute/plan-and-execute/#planning-step
prompt
keep in mind there are multiple agents under the supervisor

pass plan to supervisor 
supervisor will follow the plan and assign the tasks accrodingly

so agents 
retrival agent
calculation agent
reranking?




so today i want to try the api thing
and try to scrape the data of outlets and put in a db


so plan > query > answer question


so do i really need the context thing inside the prompt?
