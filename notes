so now main issue is the querying of vector db
db does not know expensive = higher number


so how do i incoporate agents into this 

i need a planner 
https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/plan-and-execute/plan-and-execute/#planning-step
prompt
keep in mind there are multiple agents under the supervisor

pass plan to supervisor 
supervisor will follow the plan and assign the tasks accrodingly

so agents 
retrival agent
calculation agent
reranking?




so today i want to try the api thing
and try to scrape the data of outlets and put in a db


so plan > query > answer question


to my understanding, if i dont have things that eval my first answer or query, i dont need an agent 
so if i dont grade my query or grade my answer, i just need a chain 
if the method is very deterministic, i would just need a chain no need for an agent

{'write_query': {'query': "SELECT closing_time FROM operation WHERE store_name = 'ZUS Coffee – Temu Business Centre City Of Elmina' AND day = 'Monday' LIMIT 1"}}
{'execute_query': {'result': "[('21:40',)]"}}
{'generate_answer': {'answer': 'Based on the SQL query and result provided, it seems there might be a slight mismatch between the user\'s question and the information being retrieved. The user asked whether "Temu Business Centre City Of Elmina" is open on Mondays, but the SQL query attempts to retrieve closing time for \'ZUS Coffee – Temu Business Centre City Of Elmina\'. Assuming that \'ZUS Coffee\' is indeed part of or within the "Temu Business Centre City Of Elmina", we can infer from the result.\n\nThe SQL Result indicates a closing time of 21:40 (9:40 PM) on Monday for this store, which implies it is open and operates until that time. However, if the question was intended to be about another specific entity within "Temu Business Centre City Of Elmina", we would need additional queries or information to provide an accurate answer.\n\nGiven the provided data:\n- The location in question (ZUS Coffee – Temu Business Centre City Of Elmina) is open and closes at 21:40 on Monday. \n\nIf you require information about a different store within "Temu Business Centre City Of Elmina", please specify, and I can help formulate the correct query for

for example this means i would need an tool to review the answer, so for this i need an agent that has multiple tools?
actually dont need an agent? since if i were to do it  in a chain, the node replies yes/no, so in a sense its just an "while" loop


so the api loop will be 



so llm prompt will be 
you have access to 2 api endpoints
one queries a vector data base that stores product information 
and another queries information about outlet information like store name, address and operating hours



question from user 
app host will trigger the llm, llm will tell host on what tools to use with the question provided 
use the tool, query the nessary information 
pass back to the llm 
generate an answer based on information



so for area distance 
i need to get coordinates of all the current outlets that are in the db 
then when quried when the question which store is nearest to me 
i will need to covert that into coordinates as well
but how do i start searching?
start small in query if not found in the radius expand radius?
till there is a hit ?


or can i just use tavily?


make a dummy function that retunrs something
